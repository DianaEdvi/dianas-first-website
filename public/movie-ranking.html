<h1>The Best Movies According to Vin</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is a movie about space travel and earth dying. It is super cool and the music is beautiful and Anne Hathaway is in it and shes hot.
    It also has the "It's impossible" "No, it's necessary" line which is dope. </p>
<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy</h3>
<p>This movie is hilarious imo. It's about a group of idiots trying to make a living and get on with their lives when
    they end up in prison together and need each other to escape. Also Thanos is trying to get an Infinity Stone. My favourite interaction is the following:</p>
<p>"His people are completely literal. Anything you
    say will go over his head."<br>"Nothing goes over my head. I would catch it."
<p>I adore this movie and don't like how the series ended
    bcs it means my girl Gamora never lives her life out with Quill and it's SAD.</p>
<h3>The Sound of Music</h3>
<p>Dang, first movie not about space. This movie is my childhood and I have so much newfound respect for the Baroness
    like my man Georg just DROPPED the woman he was dating for MONTHS maybe even a year for this new chick who sang a few
    pretty songs. SMDH. Like yes we know the Baroness is awful with kids and that would ultimately be a dealbreaker but at
    least tell her that dude. You just broke up with her and she saw right through you little shit.</p>
