<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Diana, but I also go by Vin online. I am a second year CompSci student from Concordia University. I love learning and exploring new mediums, and hope to work on games in the future.
  Most of my free time is spent playing Overwatch with my Concordia Esports Team, Concordia Wildwind, but I also enjoy reading and hanging
out with my friends. I enjoy watching series as well, and have a special place in my heart for children's movies and TV shows.
I also participate in the Hungarian Scout community, where I create activities for children between the ages of 5 and 17. </p>

<p>My programming skills include Java and C# (intermediate), and I am currently teaching myself
 HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have also worked with the Unity Engine and consider myself to have a basic-intermediate understanding of the program.
  My plans for the summer (2024) are to hone my web programming skills, with my main goal being to create a Minesweeper clone.</p>
